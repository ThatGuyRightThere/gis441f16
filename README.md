## Introduction
This course will introduce the concepts and theories of animated-interactive
cartography and geovisualization in a computationally based manner. To support
the latter a major component of the course will rely several new visualization
and mapping technologies for the web including cartopy (Python), Folium
(Python), D3 (JavaScript) and Bokeh (Python),  among others.  In addition to a series
of in-class exercises that introduce these technologies, students will apply
their newly acquired technical skill sets to a final project in exploratory
geovisualization.

## Objectives

1. Introduction to basic theory in cartography and geovisualization
2. Introduction to the application of geovisualization to different research domains
2. Acquire computational skills  for rapid prototyping of effective data visualizations
3. Experience in designing, implementing and testing an empirical project that combines core theory with software development

## Prerequisites

1. Interest in geovisualization
2. A grade of B or better in GIS 321 Programming for GIS


## Grading

Course final letter grades will be assigned as follows:

Letter | Points
------ | ----------
A+     |97
A      |93
A-     |90
B+     |87
B      |83
B-     |80
C+     |77
C      |70
D      |60
E      | <60        

### Student Led Discussion

Each student will prepare a presentation on one of the key conceptual areas of
the course to be presented to the group. Lead readings for each topic will be
assigned at the beginning of the semester and each student leading a
particular discussion is expected to research and include additional readings
on that topic. This component of your course grade is based on 25 possible
points.


### Quizzes

Quizzes  will be based on the textbook, assigned videos and lectures. These
will be given during the first five minutes of class on the thursdays
beginning on week 2, Aug 25, through Oct 6.  There are not makeups for the
quizzes. Quizzes are graded on a pass(5)/fail(0). Your overall quiz grade will
be based on a maximum of 25 points .

### Project 
The capstone of GIS441 will be a final project that integrates
the theoretical and conceptual materials from lecture together with your newly
acquired technical skill sets from the exercises. Students will work on an
individual project with the instructor as a collaborator to provide feedback
and guidance as the project evolves.. All projects will be
presented on the date of the final (TBD). A short (2000-2500 words) paper
describing the substantive topic and the development of the application are
required. Full source code and data to reproduce the visualization must also be
submitted on GitHub. All final project materials are due by 12/12. Details on
the project will be given out in Week 2 of the semester.

### Participation

The success of a course is highly dependent upon the active engagement of
students as well as their collaboration with their peers. Each student's
participation in the course will be evaluated on a 5 point scale.
Participation can take many forms, from bringing new materials into
discussion, posing interesting questions, pair programming with a colleague to
help them on their project as well as suggestions for improving the course.


### Final Grade

| Component     | Points |
|---------------|-------:|
| Discussion    |     20 |
| Quizzes       |     25 |
| Project       |     50 |
| Participation |      5 |


## Computational Resources

All the software we will be using during the semester is open source. **You are
strongly encouraged to bring your own laptops to class to install these
packages**. This will allow you to more fully explore the software and work
outside of dedicated class time. We will cover the installation of the packages
in the early part of the semester.

## Readings
Slocum, T.A., R.B. McMaster, F.C. Kessler and H.H. Howard (2009)Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River. (S in schedule).

Other readings will be assigned.


##Schedule

The course is organized into three parts. In order to be able to develop your
own geovisualizations it is vital that you first acquire basic software
development skills. In Part I  we will cover fundamental concepts of
cartographic theory and geovisualization. In parallel we will introduce
particular Python libraries that relate to each theoretical concept, and that
can form key components of course projects. Part II  shifts to a studio
format where we will focus on project based learning. Here you will apply your
newly acquired (or enhanced) development skills to an emprical project
developing a geovisualization product. This second part will also include
additional theoertical and methodological concepts as needed.
